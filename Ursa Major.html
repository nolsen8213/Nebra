        <h1>Ursa Major, The Great Bear</h1>
        <p>A great bear looks down from the night sky. It is called Ursa Major. Stars make up the bear’s head, body and legs. Seven bright stars in the bear look like a big pot with a long handle. We call it the Big Dipper.</p>
        
        <p>There are so many stories about Ursa Major. In one, a goddess names Callisto was turned into a bear. One day, her son saw the bear and followed it, not knowing he was hunting his own mother. Before she could be shot, Callisto was placed in the night sky, safe from her son’s arrow.  </p>
         
        <p>Many years ago, slaves in the souther United States looked at the Big Dipper and saw a drinking gourd, hollowed out to carry water. The slaves sang a song called “Follow the Drinking Gourd.” The song told them that if they followed the stars north, they would find freedom- and they did. </p>
