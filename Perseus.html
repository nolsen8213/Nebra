        <h1>Perseus, The Hero</h1>
        <p>In the autumn night sky, look for a crooked V of stars not far from Andromeda. That’s the hero Perseus.</p>
        
        <p>Perseus was a great warrior. He even defeated Medusa, whose head was covered with serpents. She was so hideous, one look at her would turn you to stone. When Perseus fought Medusa, he used his shiny shield as a mirror. By looking at Medusa’s reflection instead, Perseus was able to kill her and cut off her head without turning to stone. </p>
         
        <p>After the battle with Medusa, Perseus happened upon <a href="Andromeda.html">Princess Andromeda.</a> She had been chained to some rocks and was being attacked by a sea monster. Perseus came to Andromeda’s rescue. He held up Medusa’s head before the creature. The monster took one look, turned to stone , sank beneath the waves and Andromeda was saved. </p>
